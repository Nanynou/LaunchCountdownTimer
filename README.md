<h1>Launch Countdown Timer - Front End Mentor</h1>


I used the Frontend Mentor site to assess my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The chosen challenge is to create a countdown timer following the imposed design.
Although I enjoyed doing this project, I didn't finish it perfectly. There is still a problem with the transition of the timer and the cards.
